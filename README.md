# Assignment 1 Checklist

## Things I did:

* Changed background colors, font color scheme, color of links on all pages.
* Changed font to Raleway (looked nice and simplistic without changing the look too much)
* Included 2 images, one at the top of page and one at the bottom.
* Used table to format Grading Scale (Line in between not showing up, but it is a table in the html and CSS.
* Changed colors of boxes around student groups, spaced out names and made letters bold.
* Added Navigation to pages missing it, added groups tab under navigation for all pages

## Things I need to do:

* Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.

## Things that went undone:
* Couldn't figure out how best to revise the schedule page, felt clear enough to me, so I just added a navigation to it and changed some of the colors. Also the text on the page never changed colors which made it complicated.
